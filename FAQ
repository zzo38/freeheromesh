FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS -- FREE HERO MESH

(If you have any more questions, please ask.)


=== Features/usage ===

** How to make it to automatically advance to next level if you win?

 Add the following into the .heromeshrc file:
   .?.autoWin: select 'go',-(level()+1) where level()<max_level();

** Apparently in the original you can right click on objects to read
descriptions?

 In Free Hero Mesh, this function is mapped to the middle instead of
 right button by default, but the mapping can be redefined. (By default
 in Free Hero Mesh, the right button accesses the inspection menu,
 allowing inspecting the variables of objects at that location.)

** Can the inventory and move list be displayed at the same time?

 This feature is planned, but has not been implemented yet. (If you can
 help by providing a patch or ideas about it, that might help.)

** Is there a table of contents of the levels?

 By default, CTRL+L is mapped to this function. See also class.doc for
 a description of how to customize this table. This table can also be
 queried using SQL; see sql.doc for details.


=== Programming/making puzzle set ===

** Why is there both Busy and UserSignal flags even though both flags do
the same thing?

 It is because Everett Kaser designed the MESH engine that way, but I
 don't know why it was designed that way. If you do not like to have
 both flags, then you do not have to use both.

** Why do arrays work in the way that they do?

 It is based on their working in Falling Hero, which was done that way
 to try to fit with the existing implementation, which isn't very well.
 Free Hero Mesh does it a bit differently; arrays can now be read by any
 class, and you can store references to arrays and slices of arrays.

** Do variables need to be declared?

 Variables do not need to be declared; any user-defined global or local
 variable can store any type. You can optionally specify an initial value
 for global variables; the initial value of local variables is always zero
 (you can initialize them in the INIT block if needed).

** How to copy a picture including all variants from one puzzle set to
another one?

 One way to do this is to use the "har" program (included in the misc/
 directory). Use a command such as:

   har - HERO.IMG < set1.xclass >> set2.xclass

 You can also give it a different name in the new puzzle set:

   her r OLDNAME.IMG NEWNAME.IMG < oldgame.xclass >> newgame.xclass


=== Compiling ===

** It cannot find sqlite3.o when compiling. Why not use -lsqlite3 instead?

 The version of SQLite in the package manager is not always the newest
 version. Sometimes I use features that are in released versions of SQLite
 but not necessarily in the package manager (and which versions are in the
 package manager may vary according to the distribution). The version in
 the package manager might or might not work; it is untested.

 (If you are packaging Free Hero Mesh for a package manager, then you
 should check if the SQLite in the package manager is suitable, and if so,
 you can patch the program for use in that system.)

** It didn't compile using the script, and/or there are compiler warnings,
and/or some changes were required.

 If the warnings and other issues with compilation are posted on the NNTP,
 then it can be properly discussed, and then a better compilation code can
 be written. Proper packaging for different distributions can also be
 discussed. Please provide the following information:

 - What compiler you used (including the version)

 - What operating system you are using (including the version, and the
 distribution of Linux, if you are using any)

 - What version of SQLite and SDL you are using (if the compatibility
 layer is used, specify the versions of both the compatibility layer and
 of SDL2)

 - What changes you made to the program code, if any

 - What warnings you got, if any

 - Whether or not the program worked after doing these things

 One issue is that the version of SQLite in the system package manager
 might (depending on the system) not be updated as often as it should be.
 There is no guarantee that newer versions of Free Hero Mesh will not use
 features of newer versions of SQLite (or depend on bug fixes), although
 it also might not. (However, I think it is unlikely that newer versions
 of SQLite will break it.)


=== Errors (other than compile errors) ===

** It says "FATAL: Failed to open xclass file (No such file or directory)"
when trying to load the puzzle set. How to load it correctly?

 You must use the base name. For example, if the puzzle set files are
 named "sokoban.xclass", "sokoban.class", "sokoban.level", and
 "sokoban.solution", then you must type "heromesh sokoban" to load it.
 (This assumes that the file is in the current directory. If it isn't,
 then you must also specify the directory name, in addition to the puzzle
 set base name.)

 You may also use a composite puzzle set. In this case, use the -z switch
 and pass the full name including the file name suffix.

** There is a segmentation fault.

 This is a bug in Free Hero Mesh; segmentation faults should never occur.
 Please report it so that it can be fixed. Ensure that your bug report
 includes all information needed for reproducing the bug, including the
 compiler options you used. (If you can fix it yourself, do so and then
 post the patch so that I can review it. You will still need to report
 the bug; a patch does not substitute for a bug report.)

** Trying to run Free Hero Mesh with gdb results in a "No such file or
directory" error, and it won't work.

 If you have not set up Free Hero Mesh for portable mode, then you must
 pass the -h switch to Free Hero Mesh to work with gdb (because gdb will
 set argv[0] to the full path of the executable file, and this is how
 Free Hero Mesh detects portable mode).

** Some levels of HyperHero puzzle set will display a "Attempt to use a
nonexistent object" error when trying to move a Sliding Door.

 This is deliberate, and is a part of the puzzle. A Sliding Door has two
 sides. If one side is destroyed, then the other side will remain, but
 if something tries to move it, then it will try to call the other side
 to tell it to open/close; if it doesn't exist, then it is this error.
 If it is necessary to trigger a Sliding Door in such a way that it can
 move, then you must ensure to avoid destroying it before that happens.

 (In Hero Hearts, this situation causes a GPF, and crashes the game
 engine. Fortunately, Free Hero Mesh doesn't do that.)


=== Converted puzzle sets ===

** Hero Hearts puzzles will cause errors when a Bomb or Missile explodes,
and won't display Roller animations correctly.

 The first problem is a bug in Hero Hearts (which occasionally causes a
 GPF in the Windows version, but not always, due to race conditions). This
 can be corrected by changing the line that says "From =%objFrom" in the
 #EXPLO_ANIM message block of the $Fire class to "From $Grenade is if
 From else 0 then =%objFrom".

 The second problem is not a bug, but a bad design in Hero Hearts, which
 Free Hero Mesh does not emulate. (This problem is purely visual, though.)
 To fix it, add "(Synchronize 0 4 8)" at the beginning of the file, and
 then add ":onoff %off if STOP Image 0 0 Animate else 0 Image Synchronize
 then" to the end of the INIT message block of the $Roller class and then
 add "=:onoff" at the end of the #ENABLE, #DISABLE, and #TOGGLE blocks.

** Some levels of the SANDY1 puzzle set fail with a "Type mismatch" error
before any moves are made.

 This is the fault of the author(s) of those levels. The $SwitchFloor
 class expects Misc1 to be a number, but somehow the level author put a
 class name there instead.

** The provided solutions of some levels of the SANDY1 puzzle set that
involve Green Hearts do not work.

 This is due to race conditions; they do not always work in the original
 game either.

** Level 11 of the CHESSMAZ puzzle set fails with a "Type mismatch" error
before any moves are made.

 It attempts to perform arithmetic on object references to generate random
 numbers. The generation of random numbers is not allowed (as it would
 break the replay feature).

** The provided solutions of some of the Falling Hero levels with Closer
Seekers do not work.

 I have no idea what's wrong, but I can confirm that this is true.

 (If anyone can figure out what is wrong, please tell me.)


=== Internet/communication ===

** How to access the NNTP?

 You can use a NNTP client program, often called a "newsreader" program.
 Many email programs can also do NNTP, including Mozilla Thunderbird.
 There are also specialized NNTP programs, including Pan and bystand.
 (Some are text, some are binary, and some are hybrid; you will need one
 that supports text or hybrid.)

** If would be very helpful if you could put more information and in
particular screenshots on the Fossil main page, or at the very least link
to screenshots, or create a non-Fossil webpage to show the project. They
say a picture is worth a thousand words, but in this case I think no
number of words will ever substitute for an image.

 You are probably correct. Once suitable screenshots are available, I can
 do this, and also add other information if needed.


=== Miscellaneous ===

** Is it any good?

 I suppose it is a matter of opinion, isn't it?

** Are any libre puzzle sets currently available?

 Not yet (as of this writing). However, anyone can contribute them; I
 would be interested to see what you can come up with! (I am also working
 on my own puzzle sets, too.)

** What is the MIME type and UTI for Free Hero Mesh?

 None is officially assigned, but unofficially, a composite puzzle set
 can use the following MIME type:

 application/freeheromesh.composite+hamarc

 Optional parameters for this MIME type are "codepage" which is a IBM
 code page number, and "version" which is the version of Free Hero Mesh
 (same as the numbers of the {version} macro). Both are optional.

 MIME types for the other file formats are not defined.

 The UTI for a Free Hero Mesh composite puzzle set file is:

 org.zzo38computer.freeheromesh.composite

 This UTI conforms to the following other UTIs:

 com.hamsterrepublic.lumped
 public.data

** What's the X resource manager code for? Clipboard access?

 The user configuration settings are in X resource manager format.

 Free Hero Mesh doesn't depend on the X window system; the X resource
 manager is actually not a part of the X window system, just it is
 commonly used with it. Xlib includes a part of the X resource manager,
 but Free Hero Mesh does not use Xlib (and even if it did, Xlib lacks
 an equivalent of the xrm_init_quarks function).

 Clipboard access is done using external programs; if the X window
 system is used, then this will usually be "xclip". This is configured
 in the user configuration file, so if you are not using the X window
 system then you can change it to the appropriate commands for whatever
 you are using on your computer.

** Is there documentation with tutorial or introduction?

 I like the kind of documentation that the existing one is, although I
 am aware that some people prefer a different style. Someone who is better
 at writing that different style should do so and contribute please.
