Free Hero Mesh is a puzzle game engine for grid-based puzzle games with
levels, strictly based on changing game state due to the sequence of
inputs, e.g. Sokoban and Hero Hearts.

It is also designed to be compatible with EKS Hero Mesh puzzle sets, which
must be converted to Free Hero Mesh using the provided "mbtofhm" program.
However, Free Hero Mesh adds a lot of new features and bug fixes compared
with EKS Hero Mesh, many of which have already been implemented, and many
of which have not been implemented yet.

It is available in a Fossil repository; there are two sources:

* Main: http://zzo38computer.org/fossil/heromesh.ui

* Mirror: http://chiselapp.com/user/zzo38/repository/freeheromesh

(The main source is more often updated. The changes to the main copy will
occasionally be pushed to the mirror. Contributions are not accepted at
the mirror directly; they must be made in the main repository first.)


=== Installation ===

Currently, there isn't much of this; contributions will be accepted.
There is a shell script for compiling it available, though.

Requirements:

* Linux (it should hopefully work on other POSIX systems, although this is
untested; it might use some Linux-specific functions, and I may be willing
to accept contributions if this can be fixed)

* SQLite version 3 (a recent version)

* SDL1.x (the compatibility layers have not been tested with this
software; if you have tested it please report it, and you may contribute
patches to fix it)

* A C compiler, with GNU extensions (tested with GCC; it has not been
tested with Clang, but I expect it to work; report it if it doesn't work)

* If you wish to alter some of the files, Node.js or a compatible
JavaScript runtime is required for compiling these files (you do not need
this if you do not wish to modify Free Hero Mesh)

The distributor should edit man6/heromesh.str in order to correctly
specify the directory containing the documentation files.

Before using it, you must create a file called .heromeshrc in your home
directory; you may use default.heromeshrc to start with, and then customize
it as you wish.
