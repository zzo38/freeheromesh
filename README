Free Hero Mesh is a puzzle game engine for grid-based puzzle games with
levels, strictly based on changing game state due to the sequence of
inputs, e.g. Sokoban and Hero Hearts. You can define your own classes of
objects using the Free Hero Mesh programming language.

It is also designed to be compatible with EKS Hero Mesh puzzle sets, which
must be converted to Free Hero Mesh using the provided "mbtofhm" program.
However, Free Hero Mesh adds a lot of new features and bug fixes compared
with EKS Hero Mesh, many of which have already been implemented, and many
of which have not been implemented yet.

It is available in a Fossil repository; there are two sources:

* Main: http://zzo38computer.org/fossil/heromesh.ui

* Mirror: http://chiselapp.com/user/zzo38/repository/freeheromesh

(The main source is more often updated. The changes to the main copy will
occasionally be pushed to the mirror. Contributions are not accepted at
the mirror directly; they must be made in the main repository first.)


=== Installation ===

Currently, there isn't much of this; contributions will be accepted.
There is a shell script for compiling it available, though.

Requirements:

* Linux (it should hopefully work on other POSIX systems, although this is
untested; it might use some Linux-specific functions and/or GNU-specific
functions; I may be willing to accept contributions if this can be fixed)

* SQLite version 3 (a recent version). Add a symlink to the sqlite3.o file
into the same directory with the source files.

* SDL1.x (the compatibility layers have not been tested with this
software; if you have tested it please report it, and you may contribute
patches to fix it)

* A C compiler, with GNU extensions (tested with GCC; it has not been
tested with Clang, but I expect it to work; report it if it doesn't work)

* If you wish to alter some of the files, Node.js or a compatible
JavaScript runtime is required for compiling these files (you do not need
this if you do not wish to modify Free Hero Mesh)

* The smallxrm is required. It is included with this package; you must
compile smallxrm.c as smallxrm.o (one way is "bash smallxrm.c").

The distributor should edit man6/heromesh.str in order to correctly
specify the directory containing the documentation files.

Before using it, you must create a file called .heromeshrc in your home
directory; you may use default.heromeshrc to start with, and then customize
it as you wish.


=== Documentation ===

Free Hero Mesh includes the following documentation files (plain text):

* ARCHITECTURE: Describes the source code of Free Hero Mesh. This is only
relevant if you wish to modify Free Hero Mesh, or if you want to look up
something in the code and want to know what file to look at.

* README: This file. Describes how to find the Fossil repository, the
installation, documentation, discussion/community.

* bindings.doc: Describes the configuration of key/mouse bindings.

* class.doc: This document describes the Free Hero Mesh programming
language. Read this if you want to define your own classes of objects.

* commandline.doc: Describes the command-line arguments. The man page
also describes the command-line arguments, although the commandline.doc
file has a more elaborate description.

* config.doc: Describes the configuration options for Free Hero Mesh.

* export.doc: The level export format is described in this file; it can
be used for importing as well as exporting.

* picedit.doc: Describes the picture editor.

* puzzleset.doc: Describes wat makes up a puzzle set.

* sql.doc: This file lists and documents each of the SQL functions and SQL
tables that are available. This is not relevant to programming the rules
of the game; it is used for user customization.


=== Community/discussion ===

For discussion of Free Hero Mesh, use the NNTP server. This is a newsgroup

* If you made up your own puzzle sets, to link to them

* To comment on other puzzle sets

* Bug reports

* Feature requests

* Patches

* Contributions to documentation, including this file

* Anything else related to Free Hero Mesh, that I may have missed

You may also post bug reports and feature requests using the ticketing
system on the Fossil repository.
