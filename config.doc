Configuration can be set in two ways. There is the .heromeshrc file in
your home directory, which is a X resource manager file, and you can also
specify settings in command-line arguments after the puzzle set name, each
of which is a X resource manager string.

In the .heromeshrc file, the first component of each resource is the name
of the puzzle set (you can use ? for all puzzle sets); in command-line,
that is omitted, and the setting name is the first component.

Some settings are boolean. For boolean settings, anything that starts with
"0", "n", "N", "f", or "F" is false, and anything that starts with "1",
"y", "Y", "t", or "T" is true. If neither, the default setting is used.

See bindings.doc for key/mouse bindings.


=== Resources ===

.altImage
  If the puzzle set contains multiple pictures with the same name and size
  then this resource controls which of those pictures is selected. The
  default setting is zero.

.audio.buffer
  Buffer length for audio, as the number of samples. In order for audio to
  work at all, this value must be set.

.audio.mmlTempo
  Define the number of quarter notes per minute. The default is 120.

.audio.mmlTuning
  The MML tuning of the A4 note, in Hz. The default is 440 Hz, but some
  people do not like that tuning, so you can change it. This setting only
  affects 24-TET sounds, and not overtone-based sounds.

.audio.mmlVolume
  MML volume, from 0 to 1; fractions are allowed. The default value is
  approximately one third. Set it to zero to disable MML sounds.

.audio.rate
  Sample rate to use for audio, in hertz. In order for audio to work at
  all, this value must be set.

.audio.standardSounds
  The name of the Hamster archive file containing the standard sounds. If
  not specified, then the standard sounds won't work.

.audio.waveVolume
  Wave volume, from 0 to 1; fractions are allowed. The default value is 1.
  If this is zero, then it will not load any sound effects, but MML sounds
  will still work (if .audio.buffer and .audio.rate are set correctly).

.autoSave
  If true, saves changes to the level and solution files when the program
  terminates. If false (default), they are only saved to the user cache
  database; to copy the changes to the level and solution files, you must
  use the .u command in SQL mode (-x), or use the -f switch.

.autoWin
  SQL statement to execute if you win a level. The format is the same as
  for a key/mouse binding, but must be a SQL statement, and the only valid
  parameters are $LEVEL and $LEVEL_ID. Furthermore, '^E', '^Q', ':s', and
  ':x' are not valid.

.codepage
  The path to the code page file. If not specified, then code pages other
  than 437 are not available (code page 437 is built-in).

.editTitle
  The window title to use in edit mode. A tilde is replaced by the name of
  the puzzle set.

.gameTitle
  The window title to use in game mode. A tilde is replaced by the name of
  the puzzle set.

.gamma
  Gamma setting. If this is set, colours are gamma corrected by the number
  specified here. The default setting is 1.0.

.imageSize
  The picture size to use, up to 255. If the puzzle set contains pictures
  of the requested size, it will use those, otherwise it will try to make
  the pictures it does have larger by integer scaling; if that also does
  not work, then it is an error.

.keyRepeat
  The keyboard repeat rate, which are two numbers, first the key repeating
  delay and then the key repeating interval.

.level
  Specifies the 1-based order number of the level to start at.

.listColumns
  Number of columns in the wide mode of the list of levels. If zero or not
  specified, determines automatically by the screen width.

.listMode
  Mode for list of levels, in hexadecimal, where bit0 is set for tall mode
  or clear for wide mode, and bit1 is set for listing the ID numbers or
  clear for listing the order numbers, and bit2 is set to display the list
  of divisions initially, instead of the list of levels.

.margin
  The X coordinate of the left margin. To the left is the status area, and
  to the right of the margin is the playfield. This should be at least 64,
  or the picture size, whichever is greater.

.maxTrigger
  If nonzero, the maximum number of times that the trigger phase may loop
  during each turn (it starts counting from zero each turn). If it loops
  more, it displays an error message and results in loss of game. (This
  does not prevent other kinds of infinite loops, though.)

.palette
  If defined, the file name of the palette to use (if not set, then the
  internal palette is used instead). The file format is hex rrggbb format
  separated by any kind of whitespaces.

.pasteCommand
  The command to use for pasting text from the clipboard. When it asks for
  a single line of text, you can push SHIFT+INSERT to paste.

.picedit.macro.?
  Define a macro in the picture editor, if you push ALT and a letter,
  will execute a SQL statement.

.progress
  If positive, how many steps between dots in the progress report for the
  auto testing mode. If negative, number of milliseconds to sleep before
  each level is executed.

.replaySpeed
  When the slow replay is used, sets the playback speed; this is a number
  of centiseconds between turns from 1 to 255.

.saveSolutions
  If true, then solutions are saved if you solve a level in less moves
  than the currently recorded solution (or if no solution is already
  recorded). This has no effect in read-only mode.

.screenFlags
  SDL flags: d = double buffer, f = full screen, h = use hardware surface,
  n = no window frame, p = hardware palette, r = allow the window to be
  resized, y = asynchronous blit, z = no parachute. Some flags might not
  work if the window manager does not support them.

.screenHeight
  Height of the window (not counting the border), in pixels. This should
  be at least 480; the default is 600.

.screenWidth
  Width of the window (not counting the border), in pixels. This should
  be at least 640; the default is 800.

.showInventory
  True means to show the inventory in the margin by default; false means
  to show the move list in the margin by default. Either way, it is
  possible to change the display at run time.

.solutionComment
  If defined, record the specified text as the solution comment, whenever
  a solution is recorded.

.solutionTimestamp
  If true, record a timestamp with the solution.

.sqlCoveringIndexScan
  Boolean controlling if SQLite will use covering index scans.

.sqlExtensions
  Names of SQLite extensions with spaces in between.

.sqlFile
  Name of the user cache database. If not set, then it will use the file
  name of the configuration file replacing "rc" at the end with "session";
  usually this is the file called .heromeshsession in the home directory,
  but with some configurations (e.g. portable mode) it might not be.

.sqlInit
  SQL codes to execute when Free Hero Mesh starts.

.sqlMemStatus
  Boolean controlling if SQL memory status is available.

.sqlSmallAllocations
  Boolean controlling if SQLite will try to make small allocations.

.stackProtection
  Controls protection from stack overflows; this only works if the C
  compiler supports this feature, otherwise there is no effect. If the
  first character is ? then the stack protection test mode will be
  activated; it will display the call stack usage. The first character
  may also be < or > for a stack growing down or up, followed by the
  maximum number of bytes to use (in decimal, or hexadecimal with "0x"
  at first). Note that not all C functions will check for the stack
  protection, so it will use a small amount more than specified here.

.traceAll
  If true, then all classes and messages are allowed for tracing. However,
  there is no effect unless tracing is enabled.

.traceObject
  If defined, and tracing is enabled, then it is an error for the
  specified object to be freed during the game; you can use this to
  debug errors with the use of a specific non-existent objects. You
  specify as the object ID number and generation number, separated by
  a colon. (This is how it is displayed in the examination screen.)

.tracePrefix
  If defined, trace output is prefixed by the specified text.
