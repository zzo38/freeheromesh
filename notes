Some notes


=== File formats ===

Each puzzle set in Free Hero Mesh is stored as four files:
*.xclass (Hamster archive) - Pictures and user sounds
*.class (Text) - Class definitions (attributes and codes)
*.level (Hamster archive) - Levels
*.solution (Hamster archive) - Solutions to levels

An idea is to use either Hamster archive or SQLite for the .level and
.solution files. I decided to use Hamster archive, but here are some of
the advantages and disadvantages of each approach:

Advantages of using Hamster archive:
* It is a simple file format.
* You can use the "har" program to extract and alter lumps.
* There will be less bugs because it is simpler than SQLite.

Disadvantages of using Hamster archive:
* It is necessary to rewrite the entire file when it changes.

Advantages of using SQLite:
* You can read parts of the file at a time.
* You can alter records without having to rewrite everything.
* SQL can now be used for user queries and user scripts.
* You can use sqlite3 command shell to deal with the file.

Disadvantages of using SQLite:
* There will be extra overhead due to b-trees and other stuff.
* It may be necessary to deal with untrusted database schemas (unsure).
* Now SQLite must be included in this program.
